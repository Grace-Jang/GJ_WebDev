WIREFRAMING

This article provided a clear understanding of how wireframing 
serves as a foundational tool in web development. I particularly 
liked how it emphasizes the importance of clarifying the problem 
before jumping into designing. The reminder to collaborate early 
and get feedback from people does tell me the best method to improve 
and communication with different teams. The part about adjusting 
wireframes for different audiences was helpful because it showed how 
important it is to consider how different people understand wireframes.
